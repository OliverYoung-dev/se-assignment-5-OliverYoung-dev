Navigating to a Directory:

Use the cd command followed by the directory path to navigate to a specific directory. For example:
   cd path/to/directory
Running Commands:

Execute commands directly in the terminal. For example, you can run build scripts, start servers, or execute Git commands.
Opening Files:

You can open a file in VS Code from the terminal using the code command followed by the file name. For example:
  code filename.txt
 Keyboard Shortcuts:

Use Ctrl+C to terminate a running process or command.
Press Ctrl+Shift+C to copy selected text from the terminal.
Ctrl+Shift+V to paste text into the terminal.
Terminal Settings:

Customize the integrated terminal by accessing settings. Click on the gear icon in the terminal panel or go to File > Preferences > Settings and search for terminal.
Adjust settings such as shell path (terminal.integrated.shell.*), terminal font size, and whether to launch the terminal in specific directories.
Multiple Terminals:

9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

 Install Necessary Tools and Extensions:
Before you start debugging in VS Code, ensure you have the necessary tools and extensions installed, such as:

Programming Language Extension: Install the extension for the programming language you are using (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
Debugger Extension: VS Code supports debuggers for various languages. Ensure the debugger extension for your language is installed (e.g., Python, Node.js).
 Open Your Project in VS Code:
Launch VS Code.
Open your project folder by selecting File > Open Folder... from the menu or by dragging your project folder into the VS Code window.
 Create or Open the Program File:
Navigate to the file containing the code you want to debug within the VS Code Explorer view.
Open the file by double-clicking on it or right-clicking and selecting Open.
 Configure Launch Configuration:
VS Code uses launch configurations (stored in launch.json) to define how to launch and debug your program.
For a New Project:
Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
Type Debug: Open launch.json and select the appropriate environment for your programming language (e.g., Node.js, Python).
VS Code will generate a basic launch.json file with default settings.
For an Existing Project:
If launch.json already exists, ensure it's configured correctly. You may need to adjust the configuration to match your project's setup.
 Set Breakpoints:
Navigate to the line(s) of code where you want to start debugging.
Click in the gutter area (left-hand side of the editor) next to the line number to set a breakpoint. A red dot will appear, indicating the breakpoint is set.
 Start Debugging:
Press F5 or click on the Run and Debug button in the sidebar (View > Run or Ctrl+Shift+D).
VS Code will start debugging based on your configured launch configuration.
 Debugging Process:
Debug Toolbar: The debug toolbar appears at the top of the VS Code window during debugging sessions. It includes controls such as play/pause, step over, step into, step out, restart, and stop.

Debug Console: The debug console appears at the bottom of the VS Code window and displays output from your program and any logs or messages generated during debugging.

 Inspect Variables and Call Stack:
While debugging, you can hover over variables in the editor to see their current values.
Use the Watch pane in the debug sidebar to add variables or expressions to monitor their values as you step through the code.
The Call Stack pane in the debug sidebar shows the current call stack, allowing you to navigate between different function calls.
 Navigate Through Code:
Use the debug toolbar controls (step over, step into, step out) to navigate through your code line by line.
VS Code will pause execution at breakpoints and allow you to inspect variables and evaluate expressions in the debug console.
1 Stop Debugging:
Once you've finished debugging, click the Stop button in the debug toolbar or press Shift+F5 to terminate the debugging session.
10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

 Initialize a Git Repository:
Open Your Project in VS Code:

Launch VS Code.
Open your project folder by selecting File > Open Folder... from the menu or by dragging your project folder into the VS Code window.
Open the Integrated Terminal:

Press `Ctrl+`` (backtick) to open the integrated terminal in VS Code.
Initialize Git Repository:

In the integrated terminal, navigate to your project directory if not already there.
   git init
This command initializes a new Git repository in your project directory.
 Stage and Commit Changes:
Stage Changes:

Make changes to your code or files within the project.
In the integrated terminal, use the git add command to stage the changes you want to commit. For example, to stage all changes:
   git add .
Replace . with specific file names or paths to stage only those changes.
Commit Changes:

After staging changes, commit them with a descriptive message
    git commit -m "Your commit message here"
Replace "Your commit message here" with a concise and meaningful message describing the changes made in this commit.
3. Push Changes to GitHub:
Create a GitHub Repository (if not already created):

Go to GitHub (https://github.com/) and log in to your account.
Click on the + (plus) icon in the top right corner and select New repository.
Follow the prompts to create a new repository with an optional README file.
Add Remote Repository URL:

In VS Code's integrated terminal, add the remote repository URL (replace username and repo-name with your GitHub username and repository name):
    git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
This associates your local repository with the remote repository on GitHub.
Push Changes to GitHub:

Finally, push your committed changes to GitHub
    git push -u origin main
Replace main with master if you're using the master branch as the default branch.


 Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide screenshots or step-by-step instructions where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by 1st July
